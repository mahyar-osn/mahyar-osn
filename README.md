### Short bio:
- I’m a scientist 👨‍🔬, an engineer 👨‍💻, and a homo sapien 👨
- I studied physiology, medical science, computer science, mathematics, and bioengineering.
- I work as a scientific consultant (part-time) for Auckland Bioengineering Institute (where I used to be a full-time
research fellow).
- I have recently joined a synthetic biology company called <img alt="GitHub" title="GitHub" height="15" width="15" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6082104/163703097-865b323e-521e-4199-bff4-b589be95b79f.png"></a>
  <a href="https://provectusalgae.com/"> Provectus Algae Pty Ltd</a>, as a senior machine learning engineer. I am now based in Australia.

### ☕🤎
I love coffee. Love is probably an underestimation. I am crazy about coffee. Single-origin, medium roast with a small
touch of milk 👌 I usually have two coffees per day; one at 7:00 in the morning 🕖 and one at 1:00 the afternoon 🕐.

### 🎵🎶
My favourite genre of music is movie soundtracks. I listen to them every day, especially when I am working. 
I have compiled a playlist which you can listen from here

### 🎲🎮
I play video games and boardgames, but not as much as maybe 10 years ago 😢 
Anyway you can add me as your friend and we could potentially play some sessions 😃
